### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The goal is to create a simple function that takes a person's name as input and produces a personalized greeting message. This is a fundamental exercise in understanding function parameters and string manipulation.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The solution uses a template literal to construct the greeting string.

\`\`\`javascript
// Conceptual code
const greet = (name) => \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
greet('World'); // "Hello, World!"
\`\`\`

1.  **\`(name)\`**: This is the function's parameter, a placeholder for the name that will be provided when the function is called.
2.  **\`\` (Backticks)**: These define a template literal, which allows for easy embedding of variables and expressions into a string.
3.  **\`\${name}\`**: This is a placeholder inside the template literal. The value of the \`name\` variable will be inserted at this position.

### 📚 Key Concepts
-   **Functions**: A block of code designed to perform a particular task.
-   **Parameters**: Variables listed as a part of a function definition.
-   **Template Literals**: A modern way to create strings in JavaScript that allows for embedded expressions.

  'sum-two-numbers': `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a basic arithmetic problem designed to test your ability to write a function that accepts numerical inputs, performs a calculation, and returns the result.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The function takes two numbers, converts them to a numeric type to be safe, and adds them.

\`\`\`javascript
// Conceptual code
const sum = (num1, num2) => Number(num1) + Number(num2);
sum(5, 10); // 15
\`\`\`

1.  **\`(num1, num2)\`**: The function accepts two parameters.
2.  **\`Number(...)\`**: This ensures that the inputs, which might be strings from a form, are converted into actual numbers before the calculation.
3.  **\`+\` Operator**: The standard addition operator is used to sum the two numbers.

### 📚 Key Concepts
-   **Arithmetic Operators**: Symbols that perform mathematical operations, like addition (\`+\`).
-   **Type Conversion**: Explicitly converting values from one type to another (e.g., string to number) to prevent unexpected behavior.
