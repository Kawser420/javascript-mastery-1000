  "node-global-process": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the Node.js runtime environment. Unlike browsers, which have a \`window\` global object, Node.js provides a global object named \`process\`. This object gives you information about and control over the current Node.js process. The task is to understand its key properties.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`process\` object is available globally in any Node.js script.
\`\`\`javascript
// Accessing command-line arguments
// If you run: node my-script.js user=alice mode=test
console.log(process.argv);
// Output: ['/path/to/node', '/path/to/my-script.js', 'user=alice', 'mode=test']

// Accessing environment variables
// If you run: API_KEY=123 node my-script.js
console.log(process.env.API_KEY); // "123"

// Exit the process
process.exit(0); // 0 indicates a successful exit
\`\`\`
1.  **\`process.argv\`**: An array containing the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched.
2.  **\`process.env\`**: An object containing the user environment variables. This is the standard way to pass configuration (like API keys) to a Node.js application.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Node.js Runtime**: The environment in which server-side JavaScript code is executed.
-   **Global Objects**: Objects that are available in all modules without needing to be imported.
`,
  "node-commonjs-modules": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the module system used in Node.js. By default, Node.js uses the **CommonJS** module system. The goal is to understand the basic syntax for creating a module and using it in another file.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The system relies on the \`module.exports\` object and the \`require()\` function.

**File 1: \`math.js\` (The Module)**
\`\`\`javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
// Add a property to the module.exports object
module.exports.add = add;
\`\`\`

**File 2: \`main.js\` (The Consumer)**
\`\`\`javascript
// Use require() to import the module's exports
const math = require('./math.js');
console.log(math.add(2, 3));    // 5
\`\`\`
1.  **\`module.exports\`**: An object, initially empty, that is present in every CommonJS module. Whatever you assign to this object is what will be exported.
2.  **\`require('./math.js')\`**: A built-in function that takes a module path, executes the module's code once, and returns its \`module.exports\` object.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **CommonJS (CJS)**: The synchronous module system that is the traditional standard in Node.js.
-   **\`require\`**: The function used to import modules.
-   **\`module.exports\`**: The object a module makes available to other modules.

  "node-fs-readfile": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A key capability of a backend environment like Node.js is interacting with the server's file system. The task is to understand the basic conceptual code for reading a file's content using Node's built-in \`fs\` (File System) module.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution shows the standard asynchronous, callback-based pattern for reading a file.
\`\`\`javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('/path/to/my-file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  // 1. Check for an error first
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading the file:", err);
    return;
  }
  
  // 2. If no error, process the data
  console.log("File content:", data);
});
\`\`\`
1.  **\`fs.readFile(...)\`**: This is the asynchronous function to read a file. It does not block the event loop.
2.  **"Error-First" Callback**: The callback function's first argument is always an \`err\` object. If the operation was successful, \`err\` will be \`null\`. This is a crucial convention to check for.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **\`fs\` Module**: Node.js's built-in module for all file system operations.
-   **Asynchronous I/O**: Node.js starts the operation and executes the callback when it's done, keeping the server responsive.
-   **Error-First Callback**: A standard convention in Node.js for asynchronous functions.
`,
  "node-fs-writefile": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The counterpart to reading files is writing them. The task is to understand the basic code for writing content to a file using the asynchronous \`fs.writeFile\` method.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`fs.writeFile\` function takes the file path, the content to write, and an optional callback that runs after the write operation is complete.
\`\`\`javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'This is the content to be written.';
fs.writeFile('/path/to/new-file.txt', content, 'utf8', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error writing to file:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('The file has been successfully saved!');
});
\`\`\`
1.  **\`fs.writeFile(...)\`**: This function will create the file if it does not exist, or completely overwrite it if it does.
2.  **Asynchronous**: This operation is non-blocking. The script continues while the file is being written to disk.
3.  **Callback**: The callback receives only an \`err\` argument, as there is no data to return on a successful write.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **File System I/O**: A fundamental capability of a backend environment.
`,
  "node-http-server": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The most fundamental task for a backend is to listen for and respond to network requests. Node.js has a powerful built-in \`http\` module that allows you to create an HTTP server with very little code. This problem shows the conceptual "hello world" of creating a basic server.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution uses the \`http.createServer()\` method.
\`\`\`javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // This callback runs for every incoming request
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running...');
});
\`\`\`
1.  **Request Listener**: The callback function passed to \`createServer\` receives two important objects: \`req\` (Request) and \`res\` (Response).
2.  **\`server.listen(...)\`**: This method tells the server to start listening for incoming connections on a specific network port and hostname.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **\`http\` Module**: Node.js's built-in module for creating HTTP servers and clients.
-   **Request/Response Cycle**: The fundamental model of client-server communication.
`,
  "node-event-emitter": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Node.js \`events\` module provides an \`EventEmitter\` class, which is a cornerstone of asynchronous event-driven architecture in Node.js. It allows you to create objects that can emit named events and have other parts of the application listen for those events.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  Create an instance of \`EventEmitter\`.
2.  Use the \`.on(eventName, listener)\` method to subscribe to an event.
3.  Use the \`.emit(eventName, ...args)\` method to trigger the event and pass data to the listeners.
\`\`\`javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('myEvent', (data) => {
  console.log('An event occurred!', data);
});

myEmitter.emit('myEvent', { id: 1, message: 'hello' });

  "node-path-module": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`path\` module is a core Node.js utility for handling and transforming file paths. It's crucial because different operating systems use different path delimiters (\`/\` for Linux/macOS, \`\\\\\` for Windows). The \`path\` module provides a cross-platform way to work with paths.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The module provides several useful methods.
\`\`\`javascript
const path = require('path');

// Joins path segments together using the platform-specific separator
const fullPath = path.join('/users', 'test', 'files', '..', 'data.txt');
// Result: '/users/test/data.txt' (it also normalizes the path)

// Gets the extension of a file
const ext = path.extname(fullPath); // ".txt"

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Writing code that works correctly on different operating systems.
- **Path Manipulation**: A common requirement in backend applications that deal with files.
`,
  "node-event-loop-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the Node.js Event Loop, which is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite being single-threaded. It's more complex than the browser's loop.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The Node.js loop proceeds through a series of distinct phases in a cycle:
1.  **Timers**: Executes callbacks for \`setTimeout()\` and \`setInterval()\`.
2.  **Pending Callbacks**: Executes I/O callbacks that were deferred to the next loop iteration.
3.  **Poll**: Retrieves new I/O events; executes most I/O-related callbacks here. The loop may block here if there's nothing else to do.
4.  **Check**: Executes callbacks for \`setImmediate()\`.
5.  **Close Callbacks**: Executes close event handlers (e.g., \`socket.on('close', ...)\`).

**Microtasks** (from \`process.nextTick\` and Promises) are executed in between each of these phases, and also between each callback within a phase.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Event Loop**: The core mechanism that powers Node.js's asynchronous, non-blocking architecture.
`,
  "node-fs-promises": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
While the callback-based \`fs\` module is classic, modern Node.js provides a promise-based version that is much cleaner to use with \`async/await\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`fs/promises\` module is imported, and its methods are used with \`async/await\` and \`try...catch\` for error handling.
\`\`\`javascript
const fs = require('fs/promises');

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('/path/to/file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);

`,
  "node-streams-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Streams are one of the most powerful concepts in Node.js. They are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion, in small chunks. This is extremely memory-efficient for handling large files or network data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The most common way to use streams is with the \`.pipe()\` method, which takes the output of a readable stream and connects it to the input of a writable stream.
\`\`\`javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib');

// Create a readable stream from a large file
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('large-file.txt');

// Create a transform stream to compress the data
const gzip = zlib.createGzip();

// Create a writable stream to a new file
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('large-file.txt.gz');

// Pipe the streams together
readStream.pipe(gzip).pipe(writeStream);
\`\`\`
This pipeline reads, compresses, and writes the large file using a very small, constant amount of memory.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Streams**: A fundamental concept for efficient data handling in Node.js.
- **Piping**: The mechanism for connecting streams together to form a data processing pipeline.
`,
  "node-buffers-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A \`Buffer\` is a Node.js-specific class for handling raw binary data. JavaScript's strings are not well-suited for this, as they are typically UTF-8 encoded. Buffers are essential when dealing with TCP streams, file system operations, or other contexts where you need to work with binary data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A buffer can be created from a string.
\`\`\`javascript
// Create a buffer from a string with a specific encoding
const buf = Buffer.from('Hello, World!', 'utf8');

console.log(buf); // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f ... >
console.log(buf.toString()); // "Hello, World!"
console.log(buf.length); // 13 (bytes, not characters)
\`\`\`
Buffers are essentially arrays of integers (bytes) and can be manipulated at a low level. They are a key part of the I/O operations in Node.js.

### üìö Key Concepts

`,
  "node-dirname-filename": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about two special, module-local variables available in the **CommonJS** module system.
- **\`\_\_filename\`**: A string containing the absolute path of the currently executing script file.
- **\`\_\_dirname\`**: A string containing the absolute path of the directory that the currently executing script file is in.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
In a script located at \`/Users/me/project/src/app.js\`:
-   \`console.log(__filename);\` would output \`/Users/me/project/src/app.js\`.
-   \`console.log(__dirname);\` would output \`/Users/me/project/src\`.

These are extremely useful for creating paths to other files relative to the current script's location, e.g., \`path.join(__dirname, 'templates')\`.

**Note**: These are not available in native ES Modules. The equivalent is to use \`import.meta.url\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Module Context**: These variables are part of the wrapper function that CommonJS uses to provide a module-local scope.

This shows the "native" way to make an HTTP GET request in Node.js using the built-in \`http\` or \`https\` module. While modern code often uses libraries like \`axios\` or \`node-fetch\`, understanding the built-in module is important.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The API is event-driven. \`https.get\` returns a request object, and you listen for events on the response object.
\`\`\`javascript
const https = require('https');

  "node-express-routing-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Routing in Express.js allows you to map incoming requests to specific handler functions. This example shows how to define a route that captures a dynamic "path parameter."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A route is defined for \`/users/:id\`. The \`:id\` part is a placeholder for a dynamic value.
\`\`\`javascript
// GET /users/123
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Express parses the ID from the URL and puts it in req.params
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(\`Fetching user with ID: \${userId}\`);

  "node-express-middleware-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Middleware functions are the heart of Express.js. They are functions that have access to the request object (\`req\`), the response object (\`res\`), and the \`next\` function in the application's request-response cycle. They can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, and end the cycle or pass control to the next middleware.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simple logger middleware is shown.
\`\`\`javascript
const myLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(\`[LOG] \${req.method} \${req.url}\`);
  // Pass control to the next middleware in the stack
  next(); 
};

// Use the middleware for all requests
app.use(myLogger);
\`\`\`
1.  **Function Signature**: Middleware takes \`(\`req, res, next\`)\`.
2.  **\`next()\`**: This is the crucial part. Calling \`next()\` passes control to the next middleware function. If you don't call \`next()\`, the request will be left hanging.

  "node-fs-read-stream": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
When reading a very large file, using \`fs.readFile\` would attempt to load the entire file into memory at once, which can be inefficient or cause the program to crash. A **readable stream** is the solution. It reads the file in small, manageable chunks and emits a \`data\` event for each chunk.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`fs.createReadStream\` is used to create a readable stream.
\`\`\`javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./large-file.log', { encoding: 'utf8' });

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log('--- NEW CHUNK ---');
  console.log(chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('No more data.');
});

  "node-fs-write-stream": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Similar to reading, writing a very large amount of data to a file at once can be inefficient. A **writable stream** provides an interface for writing data in chunks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`fs.createWriteStream\` is used. You write to it with the \`.write()\` method and call \`.end()\` when you're done.
\`\`\`javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('./output.txt');

writeStream.write('Chunk 1\\n');
writeStream.write('Chunk 2\\n');
writeStream.end('This is the final chunk.');

`,
  "node-http-post-data": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
In a plain Node.js HTTP server, the body of an incoming POST request is not available immediately. It arrives as a stream of data. You need to listen for \`data\` events to collect the chunks and an \`end\` event to know when you have the complete body.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Event listeners are attached to the \`req\` object.
\`\`\`javascript
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/submit') {
    let body = '';
    // Collect the data chunks
    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk.toString();
    });
    // When the data is all received
    req.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Received body:', body);
      res.end('Data received');

  "node-cluster-module-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Because the Node.js event loop is single-threaded, a single Node.js process can only run on one CPU core. The \`cluster\` module is a core module that allows you to take advantage of multi-core systems by creating a cluster of Node.js processes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The pattern involves a single **master** process that forks multiple **worker** processes.
\`\`\`javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(\`Master \${process.pid} is running\`);
  // Fork workers.
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();

  "node-caching-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Caching is a critical performance optimization strategy in backend applications. A simple in-memory cache can be implemented in Node.js to store the results of expensive operations (like database queries or API calls) and serve them quickly for subsequent identical requests.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simple cache can be implemented with a \`Map\` or a plain object.
\`\`\`javascript
const cache = new Map();

async function getUser(id) {
  // 1. Check the cache first
  if (cache.has(id)) {

  "node-timers-module": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the different timer functions in Node.js and their execution order within the event loop.
- **\`setTimeout(cb, ms)\`**: Schedules a callback to run after a minimum threshold of \`ms\` milliseconds has passed, during the **timers** phase of the event loop.
- **\`setInterval(cb, ms)\`**: Schedules a callback to run repeatedly every \`ms\` milliseconds.
- **\`setImmediate(cb)\`**: Schedules a callback to run in the **check** phase of the event loop, which happens *after* the poll phase (where I/O callbacks run). It's effectively "as soon as possible after I/O".

**Order**: In an I/O cycle, \`setTimeout(fn, 0)\` might run before or after \`setImmediate(fn)\`, as its execution is tied to system timer granularity. However, \`process.nextTick()\` (a microtask) will always run before any of them.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's the most common standard for building web APIs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The core principles are:
1.  **Resources**: Data is modeled as resources (e.g., "users", "products"). Each resource has a unique identifier (URI), like \`/users/123\`.
2.  **HTTP Verbs**: Standard HTTP methods are used to perform actions on these resources.
    -   \`GET /users\`: Retrieve a list of all users.
    -   \`POST /users\`: Create a new user.
    -   \`PUT /users/123\`: Update user 123.
    -   \`DELETE /users/123\`: Delete user 123.
3.  **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the request. The server does not store any client session state.
4.  **Representations**: Data is exchanged in a standard format, most commonly JSON.

  "node-authentication-jwt-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. They are commonly used for stateless authentication in APIs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The authentication flow is as follows:
1.  **Login**: A user submits their credentials (e.g., email/password) to a login endpoint.
2.  **Verification**: The server verifies the credentials against the database.
3.  **Token Creation**: If valid, the server creates a JWT. The token's **payload** contains claims (e.g., \`userId\`, \`role\`). The server then **signs** the token using a secret key.
4.  **Send Token**: The server sends the signed JWT back to the client.
5.  **Client Storage**: The client stores the JWT (e.g., in \`localStorage\` or a cookie).
6.  **Authenticated Requests**: For subsequent requests to protected endpoints, the client includes the JWT in the \`Authorization\` header, typically as \`Authorization: Bearer <token>\`.
7.  **Server Verification**: The server's middleware verifies the token's signature using the secret key. If the signature is valid, the server trusts the claims in the payload and processes the request.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Stateless Authentication**: The server doesn't need to store session information. All the necessary user info is in the self-contained JWT.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: A standard for secure and compact token-based authentication.

  "node-error-handling-middleware": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Express has a built-in mechanism for centralized error handling. An "error-handling middleware" is a special type of middleware function that has four arguments instead of three: \`(\`err, req, res, next\`)\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This middleware is defined *after* all other \`app.use()\` and route calls.
\`\`\`javascript
// A route that might have an error
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  if (isNaN(req.params.id)) {
    // Pass an error to the 'next' function
    return next(new Error('User ID must be a number.'));

// The error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
\`\`\`
1.  **Triggering**: When you call \`next(err)\` with an argument from any route handler, Express skips all other regular middleware and jumps directly to the first error-handling middleware.
2.  **Centralization**: This allows you to have a single, consistent place to handle all errors in your application.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
Node.js now has full support for the standard ES Module system (\`import\`/\`export\`). There are two main ways to tell Node.js to treat your files as ESM.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **Use \`.mjs\` extension**: If you name your files with a \`.mjs\` extension, Node.js will always treat them as ES Modules.
    \`\`\`javascript
    // --- In file: app.mjs ---
    import fs from 'fs'; // You can import built-ins
    export const myVar = 1;
    \`\`\`
2.  **Set \`"type": "module"\` in \`package.json\`**: This is the more common, modern approach. It tells Node.js that all files with a \`.js\` extension in that package are ES Modules.
    \`\`\`json
    {

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual overview of key security considerations for a Node.js backend.
### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **Validate All User Input**: Never trust data from the client. Use libraries like Zod or Joi to validate the shape, type, and content of request bodies, parameters, and query strings. This prevents injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
2.  **Use Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Protection**: Use middleware (like \`express-rate-limit\`) to prevent a single IP from making too many requests in a short period, which can mitigate denial-of-service and password guessing attacks.
3.  **Secure Dependencies**: Regularly run \`npm audit\` to find and fix known vulnerabilities in your third-party packages.
4.  **Use Helmet**: In Express, the \`helmet\` middleware sets various secure HTTP headers (like \`Content-Security-Policy\` and \`X-XSS-Protection\`) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
5.  **Don't Run as Root**: Run your Node.js process as a non-root user to limit the potential damage if the process is compromised.
