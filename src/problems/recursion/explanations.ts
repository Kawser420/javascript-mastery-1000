  'factorial-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. A factorial, denoted by \`n!\`, is the product of all positive integers up to \`n\`. A recursive function is one that calls itself to solve a problem. It needs a base case to stop and a recursive step to continue.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution directly translates the mathematical definition of factorial (\`n! = n * (n-1)!\`) into a recursive function.
\`\`\`javascript
function factorial(x) {
    // Base case: The simplest case that stops the recursion. 0! is 1.
    if (x === 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Recursive step: The function calls itself with a smaller problem.
    return x * factorial(x - 1);
}
\`\`\`
-   **Base Case**: \`if (x === 0) { return 1; }\`. This is the stopping condition. When the input gets down to 0, the chain of recursive calls starts to resolve.
-   **Recursive Step**: \`return x * factorial(x - 1);\`. The function calls itself with a decremented number (\`x - 1\`). It multiplies the current number \`x\` by the result of the factorial of the next smaller number.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Recursion**: A problem-solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
-   **Base Case**: The condition that terminates the recursion. Without it, you get a stack overflow error.

  'fibonacci-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The task is to find the Nth number in this sequence using a recursive function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution is a direct implementation of the recursive definition: \`fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function fib(x) {
    // Base cases: Two base cases are needed to start the sequence.
    if (x <= 1) {
        return x;
    }
    // Recursive step: The function calls itself twice.
    return fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2);
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Cases**: \`if (x <= 1) { return x; }\` handles both \`fib(0)\` (returns 0) and \`fib(1)\` (returns 1).
2.  **Recursive Step**: \`return fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2);\`. The function calls itself twice to get the two preceding numbers and adds them. This is inefficient due to re-calculating the same values many times, but it's a classic recursion example.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Tree Recursion**: When a recursive function makes more than one recursive call in its recursive step, its call structure branches out like a tree.
-   **Computational Complexity**: This simple recursive solution has an exponential time complexity (O(2^n)), which is very slow for larger numbers.
`,
  'sum-array-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to calculate the sum of all numbers in an array using recursion instead of a standard loop. The recursive approach involves breaking the problem down: the sum of an array is the first element plus the sum of the rest of the array.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function adds the first element to the result of calling itself with the remainder of the array.
\`\`\`javascript
function sum(array) {
    // Base case: The sum of an empty array is 0.
    if (array.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    // Recursive step: Add the first element to the sum of the rest.
    return array[0] + sum(array.slice(1));
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: \`if (array.length === 0) { return 0; }\`. This is our stopping condition.
2.  **Recursive Step**: It takes the first element (\`array[0]\`) and adds it to the result of calling \`sum\` on a smaller version of the array (\`array.slice(1)\`), which contains all elements except the first.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Divide and Conquer**: A strategy where a problem is broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.
-   **`Array.prototype.slice()`**: A crucial method for this pattern, as it creates the "smaller problem" to pass to the next recursive call without modifying the original array.
`,
  'power-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to calculate a base number raised to the power of an exponent (e.g., 2¬≥ = 8) using recursion. The problem can be defined recursively: `x^y = x * x^(y-1)`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function multiplies the base by the result of calling itself with a decremented exponent.
\`\`\`javascript
function power(base, exp) {
    // Base case: Any number to the power of 0 is 1.
    if (exp === 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Recursive step: base * base^(exp-1)
    return base * power(base, exp - 1);
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: \`if (exp === 0) { return 1; }\` is the stopping condition.
2.  **Recursive Step**: The function breaks the problem down by multiplying the `base` with the result of `base` raised to a smaller power (`exp - 1`).

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Recursive Definition**: Translating a mathematical recursive definition into a programming function.
`,
  'reverse-string-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to reverse a string using recursion. The recursive insight is that a reversed string is its last character followed by the reverse of the rest of the string. Or, alternatively, the reverse of the first character's "tail" followed by the first character.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function recursively reverses the "substring" (the string without its first character) and then appends the first character to the end.
\`\`\`javascript
function reverse(str) {
    // Base case: The reverse of an empty string is itself.
    if (str === "") {
        return "";
    }
    // Recursive step: reverse the rest of the string, then add the first char.
    return reverse(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0);
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: An empty string is the simplest case and stops the recursion.
2.  **Recursive Step**: For "hello", it calls `reverse("ello")` and waits. When that returns "olle", it concatenates it with "h" to get "olleh".

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **String Manipulation**: Using methods like `.substring()` and `.charAt()` to break down the problem.
-   **Call Stack**: The call stack manages the intermediate results, holding onto the `str.charAt(0)` from each call until the base case is reached and the results can be concatenated on the way back up.
`,
  'is-palindrome-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. The recursive approach is to check if the first and last characters are the same. If they are, then the problem reduces to checking if the *inner* substring is also a palindrome.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function compares the first and last characters and then recursively calls itself on the substring between them.
\`\`\`javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
    // Base case: A string with 0 or 1 characters is always a palindrome.
    if (str.length <= 1) {
        return true;
    }
    // Check if first and last characters match.
    if (str[0] !== str[str.length - 1]) {
        return false;
    }
    // Recursive step: Check the inner substring.
    return isPalindrome(str.substring(1, str.length - 1));
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Cases**: An empty or single-character string is a palindrome. This stops the recursion. A mismatch of the outer characters also provides an early exit.
2.  **Recursive Step**: The problem is simplified by slicing off the first and last characters and checking the smaller string.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Recursive Problem Reduction**: The core of recursion is simplifying the problem with each call.
`,
  'range-of-numbers-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to generate an array of sequential numbers from a start to an end value using recursion.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function recursively generates the range for `n-1` and then pushes `n` onto the result.
\`\`\`javascript
function range(startNum, endNum) {
    // Base case: If start is greater than end, the range is empty.
    if (startNum > endNum) {
        return [];
    }
    // Recursive step: Generate the range up to endNum-1, then add endNum.
    const numbers = range(startNum, endNum - 1);
    numbers.push(endNum);
    return numbers;
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: When the end number becomes less than the start, we've gone past the beginning of the range and return an empty array to start building upon.
2.  **Recursive Step**: The function solves the problem for a smaller range (`endNum - 1`), and once that result is returned, it adds the current `endNum` to complete the range for its level.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Building up a result**: The final array is constructed as the recursive calls return and unwind from the call stack.
`,
  'greatest-common-divisor-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers. The Euclidean algorithm is a very efficient method for this, and it has a natural recursive definition: `gcd(a, b)` is the same as `gcd(b, a % b)`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function is a direct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.
\`\`\`javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    // Base case: When the second number is 0, the GCD is the first number.
    if (b === 0) {
        return a;
    }
    // Recursive step: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: The algorithm stops when `b` becomes 0. At this point, `a` holds the GCD.
2.  **Recursive Step**: The problem is reduced by making the smaller number the new `a` and the remainder the new `b`.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Euclidean Algorithm**: A classic, efficient algorithm for finding the GCD.
-   **Modulo Operator (`%`)**: The core of the algorithm's recursive step.

  'flatten-array-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to take a nested array (an array containing other arrays) and "flatten" it into a single-level array. Recursion is a natural fit because the process of flattening a sub-array is the same as flattening the main array.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function iterates through the input array. If an element is another array, it recursively calls itself on that element and concatenates the result. If the element is not an array, it's simply added to the result.
\`\`\`javascript
function flatten(arr) {
    let result = [];
    arr.forEach(item => {
        if (Array.isArray(item)) {
            result = result.concat(flatten(item));
        } else {
            result.push(item);
        }
    });
    return result;
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: The implicit base case is an array with no nested arrays. The loop will simply push all elements into the `result`.
2.  **Recursive Step**: `if (Array.isArray(item))`. If an item is an array, the function calls itself to handle that nested structure.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Type Checking**: Using `Array.isArray()` to determine the recursive step.
`,
  'sum-of-digits-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to sum the individual digits of a number (e.g., 123 -> 1+2+3=6). The recursive logic is: the sum of digits of `n` is its last digit (`n % 10`) plus the sum of digits of the rest of the number (`floor(n / 10)`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function uses modulo and division to break the number down.
\`\`\`javascript
function sumDigits(num) {
    // Base case: If the number is a single digit, return the number itself.
    if (num < 10) {
        return num;
    }
    // Recursive step: Add the last digit to the sum of the rest.
    return (num % 10) + sumDigits(Math.floor(num / 10));
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Case**: A single-digit number is the simplest case.
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    - `num % 10`: Gets the last digit.
    - `Math.floor(num / 10)`: Removes the last digit.
    - The function calls itself with the smaller number.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Integer Arithmetic**: Using modulo and division to manipulate numbers.
`,
  'binary-search-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a **sorted** array. The recursive approach involves checking the middle element. If it's the target, we're done. If our target is smaller, we recursively search the left half. If it's larger, we recursively search the right half.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A helper function is used to keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search space.
\`\`\`javascript
function search(arr, target, left, right) {
    // Base case: The search space is invalid, target not found.
    if (left > right) {
        return -1;
    }
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    // Base case: Target found.
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
        return mid;
    }
    // Recursive steps: Search the appropriate half.
    if (arr[mid] > target) {
        return search(arr, target, left, mid - 1);
    } else {
        return search(arr, target, mid + 1, right);
    }
}
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Divide and Conquer**: The search space is halved in each step, leading to O(log n) time complexity.
-   **Helper Function**: A common pattern in recursion where an outer function provides a clean public API and an inner, recursive function manages the complex state (like `left` and `right` indices).

  'count-occurrences-recursive': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to count how many times a specific value appears in an array using recursion. The recursive idea is: the total count is (1 if the first element is a match, 0 otherwise) + (the count of occurrences in the rest of the array).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function checks the first element and adds its result to the recursive call on the rest of the array.
\`\`\`javascript
function count(arr, target) {
    // Base case: No occurrences in an empty array.
    if (arr.length === 0) {

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function iterates over the object's keys. If a value is a number, it's added to the sum. If a value is another object, the function recursively calls itself on that object and adds the result.

The task is to generate every possible ordering (permutation) of the characters in a string. This is a classic backtracking problem, which is a form of recursion.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The recursive function works by picking each character from the "remaining" string, adding it to the "current" permutation, and then recursively calling itself with the remaining characters.

The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It involves a sequence defined by a simple rule: if a number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.

The task is to count all possible unique paths from the top-left corner of an M x N grid to the bottom-right corner, given that you can only move right or down.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The recursive insight is that the number of paths to any cell (r, c) is the sum of the paths to the cell above it (r-1, c) and the cell to its left (r, c-1). We can implement this by thinking forward: the paths from (r, c) are the sum of paths from (r+1, c) and (r, c+1).

This is a more efficient recursive algorithm for calculating powers, especially for large exponents. It's based on the observation that `x^n = (x^2)^(n/2)` if `n` is even, and `x^n = x * (x^2)^((n-1)/2)` if `n` is odd. This reduces the number of multiplications significantly.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function checks if the exponent is even or odd to determine the recursive step.

  'tower-of-hanoi-conceptual': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that is elegantly solved with recursion. The goal is to move a stack of N disks from a source peg to a destination peg using an auxiliary peg, with the rules that you can only move one disk at a time and a larger disk can never be on top of a smaller one.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The recursive solution breaks the problem of moving N disks into three simpler steps. To move N disks from Source to Destination:
1.  **Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary peg.** (This is a recursive call).
2.  **Move the Nth (largest) disk from Source to Destination peg.** (This is a single move, the "base" action of each step).
3.  **Move the N-1 disks from Auxiliary peg to Destination peg.** (This is another recursive call).

The base case for the recursion is moving a single disk (N=1), which is a direct move from source to destination.

### üìö Key Concepts

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The value at `(n, k)` is `pascal(n-1, k-1) + pascal(n-1, k)`. The base cases are the edges of the triangle, which are always 1.
\`\`\`javascript
// This function finds the value at a specific coordinate

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic recursion problem that demonstrates how code can be executed both *before* and *after* the recursive call within the same function. This influences the order of operations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function logs the number, makes the recursive call, and then logs the number again on its way back up the call stack.
\`\`\`javascript
function count(n) {

The function is defined by three simple recursive rules.
\`\`\`javascript
function A(m, n) {
    if (m === 0) {
        return n + 1;
    } else if (n === 0) {
        return A(m - 1, 1);
    } else {
        return A(m - 1, A(m, n - 1));
    }
}
\`\`\`
Even small inputs like `A(4, 2)` produce numbers so large they cannot be computed by simple programs. The solution demonstrates the concept rather than being runnable for large inputs.

This is a classic computer science puzzle. The problem is to place N chess queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be on the same row, column, or diagonal. It's solved using a recursive technique called backtracking.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A recursive function, say `solve(row)`, tries to place a queen in the current `row`.
1.  **Base Case**: If `row` is equal to N, it means we have successfully placed a queen in every row, so we have found a valid solution.
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    - Loop through every column (`col`) in the current `row`.
    - For each `col`, check if it's "safe" to place a queen at `(row, col)`. This involves checking all previous rows for conflicts in the same column or diagonals.
    - If it is safe, "place" the queen (e.g., record its position).
    - Make a recursive call to `solve(row + 1)` to try and place a queen in the next row.

1.  **Base Case**: If there are no more empty cells, the puzzle is solved, and we return `true`.
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    - For the current empty cell, try placing each number from 1 to 9.

    - If the number is valid, "place" it on the board.
    - Make a recursive call to `solve()`.
    - If the recursive call returns `true`, it means a solution was found down that path, so we propagate `true`.

Given a string and a dictionary of words, the task is to determine if the string can be broken down into a sequence of one or more words from the dictionary.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A recursive function, `canBreak(s)`, checks the string `s`.
1.  **Base Case**: If `s` is an empty string, it means we have successfully broken down the entire original string, so we return `true`.
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    - Loop through every word in the dictionary.
    - If the string `s` starts with the current `word`:
        - Make a recursive call to `canBreak()` with the *rest* of the string (`s.substring(word.length)`).
        - If that recursive call returns `true`, it means the rest of the string can also be broken down, so we have found a valid segmentation. Return `true`.

In the 0/1 version, you can either take an item or leave it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A recursive function, `knapsack(index, capacity)`, considers the item at the current `index`.
1.  **Base Case**: If `index` is less than 0 (no more items) or `capacity` is 0, we can't add any more value, so return 0.
2.  **Recursive Step**: For the item at `index`, there are two choices:
    - **Exclude the item**: The maximum value is whatever we can get from the remaining items and the same capacity. This is a recursive call: `knapsack(index - 1, capacity)`.
    - **Include the item** (only if its weight is less than or equal to the remaining capacity): The value is `item_value +` the maximum value we can get from the remaining items and the *reduced* capacity. This is a recursive call: `value[index] + knapsack(index - 1, capacity - weight[index])`.

1.  **Base Case 1**: If the current `node` is `null`, the value is not in this branch, so return `false`.
2.  **Base Case 2**: If `node.value` is equal to the target `value`, we've found it, so return `true`.
3.  **Recursive Step**: If the value wasn't found at the current node, it might be in the left subtree OR the right subtree. We recursively search both.
    - `return includes(node.left, value) || includes(node.right, value);`

  'graph-dfs-conceptual': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a key algorithm for traversing a graph. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Recursion is the most natural way to implement DFS. A critical component is tracking "visited" nodes to avoid getting stuck in infinite loops if the graph contains cycles.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A recursive function `dfs(node, visitedSet)` performs the traversal.
1.  **Base Case**: If the current `node` has already been visited (i.e., it's in the `visitedSet`), return immediately to prevent an infinite loop.
2.  **Action**:
    - Add the current `node` to the `visitedSet`.
    - Process the node (e.g., print its value).
3.  **Recursive Step**: For each `neighbor` of the current `node`, recursively call `dfs(neighbor, visitedSet)`.

Given a string of digits (like "23"), the task is to generate all possible letter combinations that the number could represent, based on a standard telephone keypad mapping (2 -> "abc", 3 -> "def", etc.). This is a backtracking problem.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough

This is a more complex version of the permutations problem. If the input array has duplicate numbers, the naive recursive approach will generate duplicate permutations. The goal is to generate only the unique permutations.

The common solution involves backtracking. To avoid duplicates, you either use a frequency map of the numbers or sort the array first. With a sorted array, you can add a check: if the current number is the same as the previous number, and the previous number has not been used in this path, skip the current number.

A recursive function `editDistance(str1, str2)` is defined.
1.  **Base Case**: If one string is empty, the distance is the length of the other string.
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    - If the last characters of both strings match, the distance is the same as the distance for the strings without their last characters: `editDistance(str1-1, str2-1)`.

A recursive function `findPath(row, col, path)` attempts to find a path starting from `(row, col)`.
1.  **Base Cases**:
    - If `(row, col)` is out of bounds or is an obstacle, return `false` (this path is invalid).
    - If `(row, col)` is the destination, add it to the path and return `true` (a solution is found).
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    - Assume the current cell `(row, col)` is part of the path.
    - First, try moving right: recursively call `findPath(row, col + 1, path)`. If this call returns `true`, it means a path was found, so we also return `true`.
    - If moving right failed, try moving down: recursively call `findPath(row + 1, col, path)`. If this call returns `true`, we return `true`.
3.  **Backtracking**: If neither moving right nor moving down leads to a solution, it means the current cell is part of a dead end. Remove it from the path and return `false`.

  'magic-index-conceptual': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A "magic index" in a sorted array `A` is an index `i` where the value at that index is equal to the index itself, i.e., `A[i] = i`. The task is to explain a recursive algorithm to find such an index if one exists. Because the array is sorted, we can use a binary search approach.

A recursive helper function implements a binary search. It takes the array and the left/right boundaries of the current search space.
\`\`\`javascript
function findMagicIndex(arr) {

    }
    return search(0, arr.length - 1);
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Base Cases**: The recursion stops if the search space is invalid (`left > right`), indicating the element was not found. It also stops if a magic index is found (`arr[mid] === mid`).
2.  **Recursive Step**: The core of the algorithm is deciding which half of the array to search next.
    - If `arr[mid] > mid`, it means that for any index `j > mid`, `arr[j]` must also be greater than `j` (since the array is sorted and values increase by at least 1). So, we only need to search the left half.
    - Conversely, if `arr[mid] < mid`, we only need to search the right half.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Binary Search**: A highly efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Its recursive nature makes it a great example of divide and conquer.
-   **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems until they become simple enough to be solved directly.
